\subsection{SMODERP2D entering an open source world}\label{ref:open_source_providers}

SMODERP2D is a project with a long history. Over the years its
development has been driven by the Department of Landscape Water
Conservation at the Czech Technical University in Prague. In 2018
SMODERP2D developers started working on a new generation of the model
in order to solve or at least to improve various critical issues of
the project. This includes most importantly a computation stability
and performance, better interoperability, and lack of
documentation. Recently SMODERP2D source code has been published on
GitHub \cite{smoderp2d-github-2019} under GNU GPL licence in order to
attract a wider audience, new developers and users.

The model is implemented in Python programming language using the
object-oriented paradigm. The original source code has been designed
with a low level of a scalability, limited readability and
interoperability. Part of the computation phase responsible for a data
preparation was restricted to a single platform only, Esri ArcGIS. In
2018 the original source code has been completely refactorized. Python
classes defining computational steps were re-organized in a
hierarchical manner. Major design-related changes have been done in
Python classes responsible for data handling and preparation using GIS
software tools. Data preparation workflow is handled by a
newly-defined base, partly abstract Python class ({\tt BaseProvider},
fig.~\ref{fig:uml_diagram}). Functionality depending on used GIS
package has been separated into new classes. This step was crucial in
order to make data preparation workflow GIS package independent. The
only supported platform, Esri ArcGIS, has been separated from a base
workflow. Based on that, a new concept of so-called “GIS providers”
has been introduced, see fig. \ref{fig:uml_diagram}. The key point is
the separation of GIS functionality related code from generic workflow
defined by the base provider. The base provider depends only on
standard builtin Python libraries. Array-like computation is performed
by a well-known Numpy library. Using GIS provider prototypes, the
SMODERP2D project can be easily extended to support another GIS
packages responsible for the data preparation phase.

\end{figure}

Currently the SMODERP2D project comes with three different GIS
providers. Support for Esri ArcGIS platform is implemented by {\tt
  ArcGISProvider}, GRASS GIS is handled by {\tt GrassGisProvider}, see
\ref{sec:grass_provider}. The {\tt CmdProvider} is triggered only when
model computation is run from a command-line. In this case it is
assumed that data preparation phase has been already performed by one
of supported GIS platforms.

Example of running computation from a command-line. Option {\it
  --typecomp roff} specifies that only model computation without data
preparation phase is triggered. It means that data has been already
prepared and stored in a pickle file distributed by {\it test.ini}
configuration file.

\begin{verbatim}
./bin/start-smoderp2d.py --typecomp roff \
 --indata tests/test.ini
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{GRASS GIS integration}\label{sec:grass_provider}
Importantly, the new SMODERP2D version extends supported GIS providers
by a GRASS-based provider. Introducing an open source GIS platform to
SMODERP2D workflow is crucial from the perspective of
interoperability. SMODERP2D users can choose between a proprietary
Esri ArcGIS platform and an open source GRASS GIS
\cite{neteler2012grass}. The GRASS GIS provider is designed similarly
to ArcGIS provider. From a Python perspective, there is only one
difference, GIS functions are accessed by PyGRASS package
\cite{ijgi2010201}. Nevertheless, an integration of GRASS tools in the
SMODERP2D project required a few improvements in GRASS GIS
itself. That was possible since GRASS GIS is an open source project
available under GNU GPL licence. These improvements have been
integrated into main GRASS GIS distribution and will be part of
upcomming GRASS GIS version 7.8.  GRASS v.to.points module
\cite{v-to-points-2019} has been extended to extract from lines start
or end nodes only. This functionality is used to determine the slope
of a polyline stream feature to ensure that its direction will always
be downslope (see fig. \ref{fig:stream_next_edge}). Another
improvement has been done in v.to.db GRASS module
\cite{v-to-db-2019}. This tool allows uploading geometry-related
information into the attribute table. Newly added option {\it
  next\_edge} allows adding information about next left and right
edge. This functionality is important for SMODERP2D in order to
determine stream network connectivity, see
fig. \ref{fig:stream_next_edge}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{figures/stream_next_edge}
    \caption{Stream segmentation procedure network connectivity}
    \label{fig:stream_next_edge}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

On the top of GRASS GIS provider a specialized GRASS {\em r.smoderp2d}
module has been designed. This tool allows an user running SMODERP2D
model computation directly from GRASS GIS working environment, see
fig. \ref{fig:r.smoderp2d}. The module can be easily installed in
GRASS GIS similarly to other extensions (so-called addons modules) by
{\em g.extension} command. By default, the {\em r.smoderp2d} module
performs data preparation phase followed by a model computation. Data
preparation only can be performed by {\em -d} flag. In this case, the
module creates a binary pickle file which can be later used for a
subsequent model computation. Note that ArcGIS Toolbox also allows
creating a pickle file for later usage. Importantly, such pickle files
are platform independent.

{\em r.smoderp2d} command-line usage example:
\begin{verbatim}
r.smoderp2d elevation=w001001 soil=soil_map \
 soil_type=Novak vegetation=soil_map \
 vegetation_type=veg rainfall_file=rainfall.txt \
 points=points2 table_soil_vegetation=tab_sv \
 table_soil_vegetation_code=soilveg \
 table_stream_shape=tab_stream_shape \
 table_stream_shape_code=smoderp stream=stream 
\end{verbatim}

    \caption{Running r.smoderp2d module from GRASS graphical user interface}
    \label{fig:r.smoderp2d}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{QGIS plugin}
Recently the SMODERP2D model has been integrated also into QGIS
environment. QGIS\footnote{https://www.qgis.org} is a widely used open
source GIS platform which can be easily extended by user-defined
plugins. A SMODERP2D QGIS plugin allows performing both data
preparatation and model computation phases in QGIS native environment,
see fig.~\ref{fig:smoderp2_qgis}. Data preparation part is ensured by
GRASS GIS provider as described in \ref{sec:grass_provider}. Note that
QGIS installation normally comes with GRASS GIS included. It means
that GRASS dependency is solved by QGIS installation
itself. Experimental code of the plugin compatible with the current
long term release QGIS version 3.4 is available from project GitHub
repository \cite{smoderp2d-github-2019}.

    \caption{SMODERP2D model implemented as QGIS plugin}
    \label{fig:smoderp2_qgis}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Python3 support}
SMODERP2D project also comes with Python 3 support, but still
supporting Python 2. Note that Python versions 2 and 3 are not
backward compatible.  Python~3 support is important from various
perspectives. Python 2 is slowly reaching end of
life\footnote{https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/}, but still
it’s used by many GIS platforms such Esri ArcGIS 10.x. Newly supported
GIS platforms by the SMODERP2D project as Esri ArcGIS Pro, (upcoming)
GRASS GIS 7.8 and QGIS 3.x are Python 3 based. On the other hand it’s
still meaningful to support both Python versions, Python 2 mainly
because of Esri ArcGIS 10.x platform.
