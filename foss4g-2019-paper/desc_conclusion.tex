This manuscript presents SMODERP2D project and recently triggered 
development. A complete SMODERP2D source code is available on GitHub 
\cite{xxx} under GNU GPL licence. SMODERP2D computational tools have 
been successfully integrated into Esri ArcGIS, GRASS GIS and QGIS desktop GIS platforms. On the top of that, the concept of so-called GIS providers allows publishing the SMODERP2D model as web processing service. Establishing experimental SMODERP2D 
OGC Web Processing Service is planned for 2019. Ongoing development 
is mainly focused on computational routines and parallel computations experiments. All the tools are currently distributed as experimental available for testing and user feedback.
Official stable release of SMODERP2D model is planned in 2020. This 
includes also user documentation which is currently under development. 
The code parallelization is a common practice in cases where 
reduction of run-time is convenient or even necessary. In the 
case of SMODERP2D model, the run-time is an issue, especially 
if multiple mid-scale hydrological basins in fine spatial 
resolution grid computation needs to be undertaken. Even 
though the SMODERP2D model does not belong in the family of forecasting 
models (where the short run-time is necessary)  the run-time speed 
up will increase usability of the model in practice and research applications.
